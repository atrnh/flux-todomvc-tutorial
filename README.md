# flux todomvc tutorial

Check out the original tutorial [here](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-todomvc)!

The only thing that's different about this repo is the setup. All you need to do is run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run watch
```

It also comes with branches organized by step, so if you're following along with the tutorial above, you can start from the very beginning by running:

```bash
git checkout -f step-1
```

where `step-1` is what everything should look like after you've completed [step 1](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-todomvc#1-getting-started) and `step-2` is what it looks like after you've completed [step 2](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-todomvc#2-set-up-todomvc-assets), etc.

When you get to [step 6](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-todomvc#6-remaining-functionality), branches are split by sub-steps. So branch `step-6-1` will correspond to 6.1 Create the NewTodo view.
